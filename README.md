# hypixel-autotip
This is the source code for 2PI's 1.8.9 Hypixel autotipper. It's kind of documented, but I didn't really go all-out. You should be able to understand everything that's going on, though, even if you don't know much Java. It's messily written since I was originally making it to be a private mod, and I didn't really care about the code. If you want to clean it up or add some stuff that you want, be my guest. I don't really care what you do. Just don't claim it as your own, and you're all gucci.

If you want to download the compiled versions in 1.8, 1.8.9, and 1.9, you can get them at www.skywars.info/autotip. They're not obfuscated and are very similar, so you should have no problems porting it to any version you like.

Enjoy :)
